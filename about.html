            	I am Peter (P110) Richards, a trustworthy and hard-working Englishman, currently working freelance 	and as part of the EterniTech collaboration. Over the past four years I have been tuning my skills in many different programming languages (mostly web-based) such as: Html, Php, Css, jQuery, Sql and turning my hand to Javascript and Java multiple times along the line. For the past year I have also been further developing my design capabilities beyond simply designing a website layout. While developing my programming skill I have also been refining my graphical design skills creating for clients, products for print.<br/><br/>
            
            	Mostly I am currently working on EterniTech projects but I am very happy to take on any web design work that you may want me to carry out for you. If you would like me to design a website for you, please see the contact us section on the right hand sidebar.<br/><br/>Thanks for taking the time to read my bio.

            	Back in 2011 I operated under the alias of P110 and under the brand of P110 Tech; in the same year I also started to work with Eternity Incurakai Studios. After working togehter for 3 years, we finally decided to give the collaboration a name in 2014 and now, any project that we work on together is under the brand of EterniTech.
