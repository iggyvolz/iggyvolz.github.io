            	I am Ryan "Iggy" Volz, a computer geek and dabbler in just about everything - music, sports, video games.  You name it, I dabble in it.<br><br>

              I am a high school senior at Allegany-Limestone Central School, a small district in the southwest part of New York State.  I am the CEO of YingaTech, a small group of programmers who collaborate online to work on everything from web design to video games (which I was head of before becoming CEO).  I am also very into music in my personal life - I am an alto saxophone player, one of only three tenors in our chorus, and one of the leading actors in our school's Drama program.  I have also played tennis for 5 years and ran cross-country for the first time this year.

        		<h1 style="margin:0;">WHAT IS 'YINGATECH'?</h1>
              On February 16, 2012, I was browsing around the help site of a website called Wikia when I stumbled upon someone who needed help creating a site for their programming group called Eternity Incurakai, so I created it for him.  Eventually, I became part of the group and became a leading programmer.  The creator eventually left in 2015, leaving me in charge.  We decided to rename the group YingaTech to reflect a change in the company, as well as make the name easier to pronounce.<br><br>

              Under YingaTech, I have learned a multitude of programming skills.  I started out learning PHP, a language designed for web servers.  I have sinced branched out to Lua, an all-around programming language which can be used almost anywhere, and Actionscript, the language that powers Flash (a popular web game platform).  I have jumped from project to project, never really finishing anything in particular, but just staying long enough to learn everything I can from the experience.
